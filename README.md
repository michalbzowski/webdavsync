Purpose of this project is to provide WebDAV synchronization tool

My main idea is to backup whole hard disk to WebDAV remote service e.g. IceDrive.net

I want to backup my hard drive content onto IceDrive and keep it (more or less) one way synchronized 

My idea is to scan hard drive structure, load it to program memory and file by file check if it is already on WebDAV remote drive. 

If there is no file on remote, program will upload it. 

I need that functionality because mannualy adding many files to remote drive take to much time and I need some tool which will do it for me.
